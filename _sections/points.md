1. ### Educate and learn
We will make opportunities for our trustees, staff and stakeholders to learn more about the key causes and solutions of climate change.

2. ### Commit Resources
We will commit resources to accelerate work that addresses the causes and impacts of climate change. (If our governing document or other factors make it difficult to directly fund such work, we will find other ways to contribute, or consider how such barriers might be overcome).

3. ### Integrate
Within all our existing programmes, priorities and processes, we will seek opportunities to contribute to a fair and lasting transition to a post carbon society, and to support adaptation to climate change impacts.

4. ### Steward our investments for a post-carbon future
We will recognise climate change as a high-level risk to our investments, and therefore to our mission. We will proactively address the risks and opportunities of a transition to a post carbon economy in our investment strategy and its implementation, recognising that our decisions can contribute to this transition being achieved.

5. ### Decarbonise our operations
We will take ambitious action to minimise the carbon footprint of our own operations.

6. ### Report on progress
We will report annually on our progress against the five goals listed above. We will continue to develop our practice, to learn from others, and to share our learning.
